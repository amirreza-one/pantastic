Question 2.  
1. There are different types of Recommendation algorithm that we can use here:  
- Content-based.  
- Collaborative filtering.  
- Neural Network.    
2. Although a better and more sophisticated model for this use case is Neural Network approach for Recommendation System, the requirement that we need a reletively fast and memory efficient model makes us to choose a more simplistic approach. In this application a hybrid model of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering can be a good option, considering the fact that we have both user-items interactions, some features for users, and some features for items.
